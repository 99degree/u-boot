# u-boot
Das u-boot source tree

This repo is tracking to codelinaro u-boot repo. The development for u-boot under this repo is aimed to add dual boot capability to an XiaoMi redmi note 9 pro int'l version. Currently the working branch is based on latest code
of caleb's public tree with my own compile adjustments. The development under this repo is not aimed to provide full function but barely useble for dual boot only. So interested dev can selectively pick some changes and back merge to caleb's tree if feasible.

The status of the boot cmds are limited and not very useful atm so dont try it seriously.

Github action manually build with latest 'next' branch weekly for test use, please find it useful.
